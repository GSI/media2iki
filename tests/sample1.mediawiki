You can ''italicize text'' by putting 2
apostrophes on ''each'' side.

3 apostrophes will '''embolden the text'''.

5 apostrophes will '''embolden''' and ''italicize''
'''''the text'''''.

(Using 4 apostrophes doesn't do anything
special -- <br /> the last pair are just
''''left over ones'''' that are included
as part of the text.)
